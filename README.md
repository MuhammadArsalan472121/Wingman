Wingman is a free dating app that allows friends and family to become matchmakers for their single friend. 
Whether it's a friend or family member who will be writing your profile, 
it provides a trusted testimonial as opposed to a self-promotional bio. 
After creating a wonderful testimonial, the Wingman will search the dating feed and view other profiles, 
and when they find a suitable match, they are able to approach and introduce their single friend. 
As Singles, you can like and swipe right on other singles that you are interested in matching with, 
then nudge your wingman to introduce you - as opposed to making a direct approach.
